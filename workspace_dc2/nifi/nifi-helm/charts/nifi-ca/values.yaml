  # When creating persistent storage, the NiFi helm chart can either reference an already-defined
  # storage class by name, such as "standard" or can define a custom storage class by specifying
  # customStorageClass: true and providing the "storageClass", "storageProvisioner" and "storageType".
  # For example, to use SSD storage on Google Compute Engine see values-gcp.yaml
  #
  # To use a storage class that already exists on the Kubernetes cluster, we can simply reference it by name.
  # For example:
  storageClass: standard
  #
  # The default storage class is used if this variable is not set.

  accessModes:  [ReadWriteOnce]

  ## Storage Capacities for persistent volumes
  # Storage capacity for the 'data' directory, which is used to hold things such as the flow.xml.gz, configuration, state, etc.
