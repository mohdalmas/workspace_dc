        to use a specific authorizer it must be configured here and it's identifier must be specified in the nifi.properties file.
        If the authorizer is a managedAuthorizer, it may need to be configured with an accessPolicyProvider and an userGroupProvider.
        This file allows for configuration of them, but they must be configured in order:

            - Legacy Authorized Users File - The full path to an existing authorized-users.xml that will be automatically

                group membership will not be calculated through the users. Will rely on group membership being defined
                through 'Group Member Attribute' if set. The value of this property is the name of the attribute in the user ldap entry that
                associates them with a group. The value of that user attribute could be a dn or group name for instance. What value is expected

                the value of the attribute defined in 'User Group Name Attribute' is referencing (i.e. name). Use of this property requires that
                'Group Search Base' is also configured.

                is expected to be the full dn of the user. If not blank, this property will define the attribute of the user ldap entry that
                the value of the attribute defined in 'Group Member Attribute' is referencing (i.e. uid). Use of this property requires that

    # Identity Mapping Properties #
    # These properties allow normalizing user identities such that identities coming from different identity providers
    # (certificates, LDAP, Kerberos) can be treated the same internally in NiFi. The following example demonstrates normalizing
    # DNs from certificates and principals from Kerberos into a common identity string:
    #
